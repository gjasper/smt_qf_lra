requirements:
    python3
    cvc5
    z3
    z3 path set on the PYTHONPATH env variable
        e.g.: 'export PYTHONPATH=<z3_path>/bin/python'

run "make" to install dependencies

once the environment is set:

    run "make test" to run a list of quick tests

    run "make benchmark" to produce a comparison between cvc5 and this implementation

    run "source sourceme"
        and then run "python3 run.py <file_name.smt2>"
